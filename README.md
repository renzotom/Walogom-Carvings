## About our project
That project is about computer game (for now) what is developed by "randomly" find team members, what join our team. We accept everyone, that is also reason, why is our game "open source" for new commits. We will be to happy, when someone help us with design, graphcis, sounds, music and coding.
## Why was that project created?
We decided to create new original game, where you pick up some score points and after..... (we don´t want spoiler now). We want to make stable game, where we will listen players and they can also develop our game via commits.
